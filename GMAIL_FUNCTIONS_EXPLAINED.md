## 🔧 How It Works Technically

### Gmail SMTP Service

```
Your App (Backend)
    ↓
Uses Nodemailer library
    ↓
Connects to Gmail SMTP server
    ↓
Sends email using your Gmail account
    ↓
Email delivered to recipient
```

### Configuration Needed:

**Two Environment Variables:**

1. **GMAIL_USER** - Your Gmail address
   - Example: `trektribe.notifications@gmail.com`
   - This is the "FROM" address users will see

2. **GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD** - 16-character app password
   - Example: `abcdefghijklmnop`
   - NOT your regular Gmail password
   - Generated from Google Account settings
   - More secure than regular password

### Why App Password (Not Regular Password)?

**Security Reasons:**
- ✅ App passwords can be revoked without changing your Gmail password
- ✅ Limited to specific function (sending emails only)
- ✅ Required when 2-Factor Authentication is enabled
- ✅ More secure for automated services
- ✅ Can create multiple for different apps

## 📞 What I Need From You

**Immediately:**
1. Deploy: `git push origin main`
2. Test create trip
3. Send console screenshot of any errors

**For Email (Anytime):**
1. Gmail address
2. Gmail app password

**Focus first on deploying and testing the create/join trip fixes!** 🎯

Once those work, we can easily add email notifications. The email is a nice-to-have feature that enhances user experience but doesn't block core functionality.
