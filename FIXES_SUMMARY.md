# üéØ Trek Tribe Fixes Summary

This document summarizes all the fixes implemented to resolve the reported issues while maintaining backward compatibility and existing functionality.

## ‚úÖ 1. User Profile Fix

**Issue:** Edit Profile button was overlapped by Upload Photo button, which was always visible.

**Solution:**
- ‚úÖ Edit Profile button is now clearly visible at the top-right of the profile page
- ‚úÖ Upload Photo button now only appears when Edit Mode is active
- ‚úÖ Clean state management: View mode shows only Edit Profile button, Edit mode shows Cancel/Save buttons and Upload Photo

**Files Modified:**
- `web/src/pages/Profile.tsx` (Lines 253-270)

**Testing:**
- Profile page loads correctly with visible Edit Profile button
- Clicking Edit Profile reveals Upload Photo option and form editing
- Cancel restores original values
- Save successfully updates profile

## ‚úÖ 2. Join Trip Fix

**Issue:** "Invalid booking data" error when joining trips due to mismatched field names and validation issues.

**Solution:**
- ‚úÖ Fixed payload structure to match backend schema exactly
- ‚úÖ Changed `numberOfGuests` to `numberOfTravelers` (backend expects this)
- ‚úÖ Ensured `contactPhone` is always included (required field)
- ‚úÖ Added proper validation for all traveler details
- ‚úÖ Only send optional fields when they have meaningful values
- ‚úÖ Removed inline payment screenshot upload (now handled separately after booking)
- ‚úÖ Display payment information clearly before booking

**Backend Schema Requirements Met:**
```typescript
{
  tripId: string (required)
  numberOfTravelers: number (required, 1-10)
  contactPhone: string (required, min 10 digits)
  selectedPackage?: { id, name, price }
  travelerDetails?: Array<{ name, age, phone, emergencyContact, medicalConditions, dietary }>
  specialRequests?: string
  emergencyContactName?: string
  emergencyContactPhone?: string
  experienceLevel?: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced'
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `web/src/components/JoinTripModal.tsx` (Lines 187-230, 654-680, 724)

**Testing:**

## ‚úÖ 3. Create Trip Fix

**Issue:** 400 Bad Request error when creating trips due to improper handling of optional fields.

**Solution:**
- ‚úÖ Initialize arrays (images, schedule) with empty arrays by default
- ‚úÖ Ensure categories always has at least one value (defaults to ['Adventure'])
- ‚úÖ Fixed paymentConfig validation - only include advanceAmount if positive
- ‚úÖ Only send optional fields with meaningful values
- ‚úÖ Improved error handling and validation messages

**Backend Schema Requirements Met:**
```typescript
{
  title: string (required)
  description: string (required)
  destination: string (required)
  price: number (required, positive)
  capacity: number (required, positive integer)
  startDate: date (required, future date)
  endDate: date (required, after startDate)
  categories: string[] (default: [])
  images: string[] (default: [])
  schedule: ScheduleDay[] (default: [])
  location?: { coordinates: [number, number] }
  paymentConfig?: {
    paymentType: 'full' | 'advance'
    advanceAmount?: number (positive if present)
    paymentMethods: string[]
    refundPolicy?: string
  }
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `web/src/pages/CreateTripNew.tsx` (Lines 267-314)

**Testing:**

- Trip with images and schedule uploads correctly
- Payment config with advance amount validates properly
