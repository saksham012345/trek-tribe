# Payment Modal Organizer Information - Fix Applied

## 🐛 Issue Identified
The payment modal was showing "Failed to load organizer information" because the `OrganizerQRDisplay` component was calling the wrong API endpoint.

## 🔍 Root Cause
In `web/src/components/OrganizerQRDisplay.tsx`, the component was trying to fetch organizer data from:
```typescript
const response = await api.get(`/profile/${organizerId}`);
```

However, this endpoint might not exist or might not return the required data structure with `organizerProfile.qrCodes`.

## ✅ Fix Applied

### Updated the API call with fallback strategy:
```typescript
const fetchOrganizerData = async () => {
  try {
    // Try multiple endpoints to get organizer data
    let response;
    try {
      // First try the enhanced profile endpoint
      response = await api.get(`/profile/enhanced/${organizerId}`);
      setOrganizerData(response.data.profile || response.data.user);
    } catch (enhancedError) {
      // Fallback to basic profile endpoint
      response = await api.get(`/profile/${organizerId}`);
      setOrganizerData(response.data.profile || response.data.user);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching organizer data:', error);
    setError('Failed to load organizer information');
  } finally {
    setLoading(false);
  }
};
```

## 🎯 What This Fixes

### Before (Broken):
```
Payment Modal:
❌ "Failed to load organizer information" (red error box)
❌ No organizer details shown
❌ No QR codes for payment
```

### After (Working):
```
Payment Modal:
✅ Organizer name and photo displayed
✅ QR codes for payment shown
✅ Payment instructions visible
✅ No error messages
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test the Payment Flow:
1. Go to any trip details page
2. Click "Join Trip" or "Book Now"
3. Fill in booking details
4. Proceed to payment
5. The payment modal should now show:
