## Testing Instructions:

### 1. Test Registration

2. Try registering with a new email - should work
3. Try registering with an existing email - should show friendly error
4. Successful registration should automatically log you in

### 2. Test Profile Features
1. Log in as any user
2. Go to `/my-profile` (Enhanced Profile)
3. **Test Edit Profile**: Click "Edit Profile" button
4. **Test Photo Upload**: 
   - Method 1: Click edit mode, then upload photo in profile section
   - Method 2: Use the small upload widget in bottom-right corner
5. **Test Profile Info**: Update bio, social links, location
6. **Save changes** and verify they persist

### 3. Test Role-Based Features
- **Travelers**: See trips joined statistics
- **Organizers**: See trips organized, participants, ratings
- **Profile sharing**: Generate and copy shareable links

### 4. Test Visual Design
- **Responsive layout** on different screen sizes
- **Color scheme** matches trek-tribe theme
- **Icons and emojis** enhance user experience

## API Endpoints Used:

- `GET /auth/me` - Get current user
- `GET /profile/me` - Get detailed profile
- `PUT /profile/me` - Update profile
- `POST /profile/photo` - Upload profile photo
- `GET /profile/me/stats` - Get profile statistics
- `POST /profile/me/share` - Generate shareable link

## Expected Behavior:

1. **Profile loads quickly** with user data and statistics
2. **Photo upload works smoothly** with progress indication
3. **Form validation prevents invalid data**
4. **Error messages are helpful** and actionable
5. **UI is attractive** and professional
6. **Mobile responsive** design works well

## Troubleshooting:

- **Photo upload fails**: Check file size (<5MB) and format (images only)
- **Profile doesn't save**: Check authentication token and network connection
- **Registration fails**: Try a different email or check error message details
- **Page doesn't load**: Verify backend is running on Render

## Next Steps for Further Enhancement:

1. **Add more social links** (Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.)
2. **Implement profile completion wizard** for new users
3. **Add profile verification system** with badges
4. **Create user achievements** and progress tracking
5. **Implement profile privacy settings**
