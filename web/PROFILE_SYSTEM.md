## Implementation Details

### Conditional Rendering Logic

```typescript
// In Profile.tsx
const Profile: React.FC<ProfileProps> = ({ user }) => {
  // ... hooks must come first
  
  // Conditional rendering after all hooks
  if (user.role === 'admin') {
    return <AdminProfile user={user} />;
  }
  
  if (user.role === 'agent') {
    return <AgentProfile user={user} />;
  }
  
  // Default organizer/traveler profile
  return (/* Standard profile JSX */);
};
```

### Key Design Differences

| Feature | Organizer/Traveler | Admin | Agent |
|---------|-------------------|-------|--------|
| **Header Color** | Nature Green | Dark Forest | Professional Blue |
| **Primary Icon** | üèîÔ∏è/üéí | üëë | üõ°Ô∏è |
| **Focus Area** | Trip Management | System Control | Customer Support |
| **Data Displayed** | Personal Trips | Platform Metrics | Chat Performance |
| **Quick Actions** | Create/Join Trips | System Management | Live Chat Tools |
