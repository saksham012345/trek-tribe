# 📧 Email Notification - Complete Status Report

## ⚠️ Current Status: NOT WORKING (Needs Configuration)

The email notification system is **fully implemented and integrated** but is **NOT configured** with Gmail credentials.

---

## ✅ What I've Done (Code is Ready)

### 1. Email Service Implementation
**File:** `services/api/src/services/emailService.ts`

- ✅ Nodemailer integration with Gmail SMTP
- ✅ Beautiful HTML email templates
- ✅ Booking confirmation emails
- ✅ Password reset emails
- ✅ Trip update emails
- ✅ Error handling and logging
- ✅ Service status checking

### 2. Integrated into Booking Flow
**File:** `services/api/src/routes/bookings.ts`

**Added email sending at two points:**

#### Point 1: When Booking Created (Line 204-233)
```typescript
// Send email notification (non-blocking)
if (emailService.isServiceReady()) {
  await emailService.sendBookingConfirmation({
    userName: user.name,
    userEmail: user.email,
    tripTitle: trip.title,
    tripDestination: trip.destination,
    startDate: formatted date,
    endDate: formatted date,
    totalTravelers: numberOfTravelers,
    totalAmount: groupBooking.finalAmount,
    organizerName: trip.organizerId.name,
    organizerEmail: trip.organizerId.email,
    organizerPhone: trip.organizerId.phone,
    bookingId: groupBooking._id.toString()
  });
  logger.info('📧 Booking confirmation email sent');
} else {
  logger.warn('⚠️  Email service not configured');
}
```

#### Point 2: When Payment Verified (Line 617-645)
```typescript
if (status === 'verified') {
  // ... verify payment logic ...
  
  // Send payment verification success email
  if (emailService.isServiceReady()) {
    const mainBooker = await User.findById(booking.mainBookerId);
    await emailService.sendBookingConfirmation({
      // ... all booking details ...
    });
    logger.info('📧 Payment verification email sent');
  } else {
    logger.warn('⚠️  Email service not configured');
  }
}
```

### 3. Added Import
**File:** `services/api/src/routes/organizer.ts`
- Ready for future organizer notifications

## ⚠️ What's Missing: Gmail Credentials

### Required Environment Variables:

```bash
GMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=abcdefghijklmnop
```

**Where to set:**
- Render Dashboard → Environment tab
- Add both variables
- Save and restart service

## 📋 Complete Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Get Gmail App Password (5 min)

1. Visit: https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. Enable "2-Step Verification" if not enabled
3. Click "App passwords"
4. Generate new password:
   - App: Mail
   - Device: Other (name it "Trek Tribe")
5. Copy the 16-character code
6. **Important:** Remove all spaces!
   - Given: `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`
   - Use: `abcdefghijklmnop`

### Step 2: Configure on Render (30 sec)

1. Open: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Select: `trek-tribe-38in` service
3. Go to: Environment tab
4. Click: "Add Environment Variable"
5. Add:
   ```
   GMAIL_USER = trektribe.notifications@gmail.com
   GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD = abcdefghijklmnop
   ```
6. Save Changes (service auto-restarts)

### Step 3: Deploy Backend Changes (1 min)

```bash
git add services/api/src/routes/bookings.ts
git add services/api/src/routes/organizer.ts

git commit -m "feat: Integrate email notifications for bookings"

git push origin main
```

### Step 4: Verify (2 min)

**Check Render Logs:**
```
Look for: ✅ Email service initialized successfully with Gmail SMTP
```

**Test Email Service:**
```bash
curl https://trek-tribe-38in.onrender.com/api/bookings/email-status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Should return:
{
  "isReady": true,

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Gmail credentials not configured"

**Check:**
1. Environment variables are set on Render
2. Variable names are exactly: `GMAIL_USER` and `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD`
3. No extra spaces in values
4. Service has restarted after adding variables

**Fix:**
- Double-check spelling of variable names
- Regenerate app password if needed
- Restart Render service manually

### "Failed to send email"

**Possible Issues:**

1. **Invalid app password**
   - Regenerate app password
   - Ensure 16 characters, no spaces
   - Copy-paste carefully

2. **2FA not enabled**
   - Enable 2-Step Verification on Gmail first
   - Then generate app password

3. **Gmail account locked**
   - Check Gmail for security alerts
   - Verify account is active
   - Check spam settings

4. **Network/firewall issues**
   - Render should have no issues
   - Gmail SMTP is port 587/465

### Emails going to spam

**Solutions:**
1. Add `noreply@trektribe.in` to contacts
2. Mark first email as "Not spam"
3. Users should whitelist your email
4. Consider custom domain email (advanced)
