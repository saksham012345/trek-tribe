## ðŸŽ¯ What I'm Looking For:

I need to see:
1. **What data** is being sent (payload)
2. **What error** the backend is returning (error object)
3. **Which field** is causing the validation failure

## ðŸš€ Quick Fix Preview:

Based on the 400 error, it's likely one of these issues:
- Missing required field
- Wrong data type (string vs number)
- Invalid date format
- Missing payment configuration
- Schema validation mismatch

Once I see the exact error details, I can fix it in 2 minutes! ðŸŽ¯
