# AI Chat Testing Guide - Quick Start

## 🧪 How to Test the Enhancements

### Prerequisites
- Ensure the backend server is running
- Frontend is running and accessible
- At least one agent account for testing handoffs

---

## Test 1: Conversation Context & Follow-up ✨

### Steps:
1. Open the chat widget on homepage
2. Type: **"Suggest some trekking trips"**
3. Wait for AI to show recommendations (various prices)
4. Type: **"under 10000"**
5. Verify AI shows only trips under ₹10,000

### Expected Results:
```
✅ AI understands "under 10000" refers to price
✅ AI filters previous recommendations
✅ Response shows trips within budget
✅ Message acknowledges the price constraint
```

### Also Test:
- "show me between 5000 and 10000"
- "above 15000"
- "trips for 8k" (k = thousands)

---

## Test 2: Clickable Trip Links 🔗

### Steps:
1. Open chat widget
2. Type: **"Recommend some trips"**
3. Look at AI response

### Expected Results:
```
✅ Each trip recommendation shows price and details
✅ Below each trip is a blue gradient button
✅ Button text: "🔗 [Trip Name]"
✅ Clicking button navigates to trip details page
✅ At least 3 clickable links appear
```

### Visual Check:
- Buttons should have gradient background (purple to blue)
- Hover effect: button lifts up slightly
- Text is white and readable

---

## Test 3: Larger Chat Widget 📱

### Steps:
1. Click chat widget icon to open
2. Observe the size

### Expected Results:
```
✅ Widget is noticeably larger (450x650px)
✅ More messages visible at once
✅ Better readability
✅ On mobile: Full screen
```

### Desktop Check:
- Width: 450px (compare with browser ruler)
- Height: 650px
- Positioned in bottom-right corner

### Mobile Check:
- Opens full screen
- No awkward sizing
- Easy to read and interact

---

## Test 4: Trip-Specific Assistance 🎯

### Steps:
1. Navigate to any trip details page (e.g., `/trips/[trip-id]`)
2. Open chat widget
3. Observe welcome message

### Expected Results:
```
✅ AI mentions the specific trip name
✅ Shows helpful menu of what it can help with:
   • Trip availability and booking
   • Organizer information
   • Pickup/drop-off locations
   • What's included
   • Itinerary details
   • Payment options
✅ Any response includes link back to current trip
```

### Try Asking:
- "What's the price?" → Should mention this specific trip
- "Tell me about the organizer" → Shows organizer details
- "Is it available?" → Shows real-time availability

---

## Test 5: Agent Notifications 🔔

### Setup:
- Login as agent in another browser/incognito window
- Keep agent dashboard open

### Steps (User Chat):
1. Open chat as regular user
2. Type: **"Talk to human agent"** OR click button
3. Observe both user and agent sides

### Expected Results (User Side):
```
✅ System message: "Request forwarded to X agent(s)"
✅ Shows how many agents available
✅ If no agents: Shows contact info (email, WhatsApp)
✅ Creates support ticket
```

### Expected Results (Agent Side):
```
✅ Agent receives notification
✅ Shows user name and message preview
✅ Agent can join the chat
✅ Multiple notification channels (redundancy)
```

### Alternative Trigger:
- Ask complex query that AI can't answer
- AI should auto-notify agents if confidence < 0.5

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Links not appearing
**Solution**: Check that recommendations are returned with trip data
```bash
# Check backend logs for:
"AI chat message processed" with tripLinks
```

### Issue 2: No agent notifications
**Solution**: Verify agent is logged in and socket connected
```bash
# Check logs for:
"User connected to chat" with role: "agent"
"Notified agents of new chat request"
```

### Issue 3: Context not maintained
**Solution**: Ensure socket is connected (check connection status indicator)
```bash
# Should see: 🟢 Online (not 🔴 Offline)
```

### Issue 4: Widget too small
**Solution**: Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R) to reload CSS
```bash
# Clear browser cache if needed
```
