## 🚀 HOW TO TEST

### 1. Start the Development Environment

```bash
# Backend API (if not already running)
cd services/api
npm run dev  # Should run on port 4000

# Frontend React App
cd web
npm start    # Should run on port 3000
```

### 2. Testing User Chat Experience

1. **Open the website** at `http://localhost:3000`
2. **Login as a regular user** (not agent/admin)
3. **Look for the blue chat button** in bottom-right corner
4. **Click to open the chat widget**
5. **Test different scenarios:**
   - Start a general support chat
   - Try "Technical Issue" or "Booking Help" buttons
   - Send messages and watch for typing indicators
   - Rate your experience when chat closes

### 3. Testing Agent Dashboard

1. **Login as an agent** (user with `role: 'agent'`)
2. **Go to the agent dashboard** at `/admin` 
3. **Click "💬 Chat Dashboard"** button in the header
4. **Or navigate directly** to `/agent/chat`
5. **Test agent features:**
   - View unassigned chats in the queue
   - Click to take/assign chats to yourself
   - Manage multiple conversations
   - Transfer chats between agents
   - Close chats with reasons

### 4. Real-Time Testing

**Best tested with two browser windows/tabs:**

1. **Window 1:** User chat widget
2. **Window 2:** Agent dashboard

**Test real-time features:**
- Send messages from user → see instantly in agent dashboard
- Reply from agent → see instantly in user widget
- Watch typing indicators appear in both interfaces
- Test connection status (disconnect internet briefly)

## 🔍 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues:

1. **Chat button not appearing:**

   - Verify API connection at `http://localhost:4000`

2. **Messages not sending:**
   - Open browser dev tools → Network tab
   - Check for Socket.io connection errors
   - Verify backend is running on port 4000

3. **Agent dashboard access denied:**
   - Ensure user has `role: 'agent'` in MongoDB
   - Check authentication token in localStorage

4. **Real-time not working:**
   - Check WebSocket connection in dev tools
   - Verify no firewall blocking WebSocket connections
   - Check for CORS issues in console

### Debug Steps:

1. **Backend logs:** Watch console output when running `npm run dev`
2. **Frontend errors:** Open browser dev tools → Console tab
3. **Network issues:** Check Network tab for failed requests
4. **Database:** Use MongoDB Compass to verify chat documents
