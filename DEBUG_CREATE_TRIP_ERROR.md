## Immediate Debug Steps

### Step 1: Check Full Error Details

I've enhanced the console logging. Now when you try to create a trip, you'll see:

```javascript
❌ Error creating trip: [full error object]
📋 Full error object: {
  "success": false,
  "error": "Validation failed",
  "details": "field: error message",
  "fields": { ... },
  "hint": "Required fields: ..."
}
🔢 Status code: 400
🔍 Error message: [error message]
📦 Full trip payload: {
  "title": "...",
  "description": "...",
  // ... all fields
}
```

### Step 2: Try Creating a Trip Again

1. Open https://www.trektribe.in/create-trip
2. Open Browser DevTools (F12)
3. Go to Console tab
4. Clear console (click 🚫 icon)
5. Fill out the form
6. Click "Create Trip"
7. **Take a screenshot of the console output**
8. Share it with me

## Common Causes & Quick Fixes

### Cause 1: Missing Required Field

**Error you'd see:**
```json
{
  "error": "Validation failed",
  "details": "description: Required",
  "fields": { "description": ["Required"] }
}
```

**Fix:** Make sure all these fields are filled:
- ✅ Title
- ✅ Description
- ✅ Destination
- ✅ Price (number > 0)
- ✅ Capacity (number >= 2)
- ✅ Start Date (future date)
- ✅ End Date (after start date)
- ✅ At least one category selected

### Cause 2: Invalid Date

**Error you'd see:**
```json
{
  "error": "End date must be after start date",
  "details": "Start: 2025-11-20, End: 2025-11-15"
}
```

**Fix:** 
- Ensure end date is after start date
- Ensure start date is in the future

### Cause 3: Invalid Price/Capacity

**Error you'd see:**
```json
{
  "error": "Validation failed",
  "details": "price: Number must be greater than 0"
}
```

**Fix:**
- Price must be > 0
- Capacity must be >= 2

### Cause 4: Authentication Issue

**Error you'd see:**
```json
{
  "error": "You do not have permission to create trips"
}
```

**Fix:**
- Ensure you're logged in
- Ensure your role is 'organizer' or 'admin'
- Check localStorage for token

## Quick Test: Minimal Trip

Try creating a trip with **minimal fields**:

```
Step 1 (Basic Information):
✓ Title: "Test Weekend Trek"
✓ Description: "A wonderful weekend getaway in the mountains"
✓ Destination: "Manali"
✓ Difficulty: Intermediate

Step 2 (Pricing & Schedule):
✓ Price: 5000
✓ Capacity: 10
✓ Start Date: [Pick a future date]
✓ End Date: [Pick date after start]
✓ Payment Type: Full Payment Required
✓ Cancellation Policy: Moderate

Step 3 (Categories):
✓ Select: "Mountain" or "Adventure" (at least one)

Step 4 (Media & Itinerary):
✓ Leave images empty
✓ Leave itinerary empty
✓ Leave schedule empty
✓ Click "Create Trip"
```

This should work! If it doesn't, the console will now show **exactly** what's wrong.

## Enhanced Debug Output

I've updated the code to show:

### In Browser Console:
```
📤 Sending trip data: { ... }
📦 Full trip payload: { 
  "title": "Test Weekend Trek",
  "description": "A wonderful weekend...",
  "destination": "Manali",
  "price": 5000,
  "capacity": 10,
  "categories": ["Mountain"],
  "startDate": "2025-11-15T00:00:00.000Z",
  "endDate": "2025-11-17T00:00:00.000Z",
  "images": [],
  "schedule": []
}

If error:
❌ Error creating trip: [error]
📋 Full error object: {
  "success": false,
  "error": "Validation failed",
  "details": "field: error message",
  "hint": "Required fields: ..."
}
```

### In Render Logs:
```
📥 Received trip creation request: { ... }

If validation fails:
❌ Validation failed: { field: ["error"] }

If success:
✅ Trip created successfully: trip_id
```
